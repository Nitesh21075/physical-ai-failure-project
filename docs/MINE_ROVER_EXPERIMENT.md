# Mine Rover Camera Experiment

`scripts/run_mine_rover_experiment.py` is the bounded Isaac Sim worker for a
mine-world run. It commands the actual Nova Carter wheel articulation, captures
RGB from `/World/Robot/VLACamera`, and records a Reactor seed handoff. It does
not move the rover chassis directly.

## Non-destructive boundary

`assets/worlds/mine_v1/mine_world.usda` and every USD it composes are campaign
inputs. For each run the worker creates:

```text
runs/<run-id>/mine_rover_derived_entry.usda  # strong layer over the source world
runs/<run-id>/mine_rover_session.usda        # session-only sensor edits
runs/<run-id>/camera/rgb_*.png               # actual RTX camera frames
runs/<run-id>/reactor_seed.json              # bounded visual-world seed
runs/<run-id>/summary.json                   # control and pose provenance
```

The derived entry layer selects Nova Carter's `Config=Full_Merged` and
`Physics=Physics_Base` variants before the remote asset is composed. These are
the lightweight, physics-capable settings; the worker never selects the
`No_Physics` variant. Every wheel name is discovered from the live articulation
and the requested linear/angular command is converted to bounded differential
wheel velocities.

## Run

From this checkout, create persistent, disposable Isaac caches once. They are
Docker volumes, not files in the world directory.

```bash
docker volume create mine-rover-isaac-cache
docker volume create mine-rover-omniverse-data
docker run --rm --gpus all --network host --user 0:0 --entrypoint bash \
  -e ACCEPT_EULA=Y -e PRIVACY_CONSENT=Y -e HOME=/tmp \
  -v mine-rover-isaac-cache:/tmp/.cache \
  -v mine-rover-omniverse-data:/tmp/.nvidia-omniverse \
  -v "$PWD:/workspace/project" \
  nvcr.io/nvidia/isaac-sim:6.0.1 \
  -lc 'cd /workspace/project && /isaac-sim/python.sh scripts/run_mine_rover_experiment.py \
    --runs-dir /workspace/project/runs --run-id mine-rover-001 \
    --linear-velocity-mps 0.25 --angular-velocity-radps 0.0 --control-steps 90'
```

Use `--disable-camera` only for an articulation/PhysX diagnostic. It produces
no RGB image and therefore intentionally produces no Reactor seed.

The first Nova Carter load can take several minutes because the reference asset
is resolved from NVIDIA's content service. Keep the two cache volumes between
runs; remove them only when intentionally forcing another cold-load experiment.

## Reactor comparison boundary

`reactor_seed.json` supplies one simulator RGB frame, the exact source/session
USD provenance, command, and before/after rover poses to a Reactor workflow.
It is an image-conditioning handoff, not a claim that a generated visual world
is simulator ground truth. Physics outcomes remain measured in Isaac through
the wheel command, contacts, and body poses; Reactor is the comparison branch.

The RTX implementation follows NVIDIA's current experimental RTX camera API,
not the deprecated `isaacsim.sensors.camera` wrapper:
